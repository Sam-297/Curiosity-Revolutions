# Curiosity Revolutions

This repository contains implementations of algorithms for generating random terrains, controlling robots, interpreting robot programs, and verifying dynamic properties. These implementations are based on a series of programming assignments.

The project is organized into several directories:

`terrain`: Contains code for reading terrain files and displaying terrain information.

`robot`: Contains code for controlling robots and simulating their movements.

`interpreter`: Contains code for interpreting robot programs and executing them on terrain.

`observer`: Contains code for verifying dynamic properties of robot programs during execution.
